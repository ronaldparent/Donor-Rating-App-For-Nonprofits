# Donor-Rating-App-For-Nonprofits
Custom Jupyter Notebook and Shiny R Studio App For Predicting Likely Donors

Donor Rating App for Nonprofits (R)
This project provides a complete R-based solution to help nonprofits predict and rank donor likelihood of giving again. The tool uses a logistic regression model to classify donors, generates a ranked scoring system (1â€“5), and includes a polished Shiny dashboard for easy use by development staff.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To enable nonprofits â€” even without data teams â€” to:

Identify donors most likely to give again

Improve targeting in fundraising campaigns

Simplify data interpretation through visualization

ðŸ“Š Features
Predictive modeling using logistic regression

Scoring system to classify donors (1 to 5)

Exportable donor list with predicted likelihoods

Clean, professional Shiny dashboard

Suitable for non-technical staff

Fully reproducible in RStudio

ðŸ§ª Model Inputs
The logistic regression model was trained on the following features:

Variable	Description
age	Donorâ€™s age
gender	Gender identity (categorical)
donation_amount	Last donation amount
channel	Fundraising channel used (email, phone, etc)
frequency	Number of gifts in past year
recency_days	Days since last donation

ðŸ”® Predicted Output
A column predicted_prob contains the probability of repeat donation

A column donor_score ranks each donor from 1 (low) to 5 (high) likelihood

Output is saved as a CSV file: donor_predictions.csv

ðŸ’» Files in This Project
donor_model.R: The full model-building and scoring script

donors.csv: Sample donor dataset (or bring your own)

donor_predictions.csv: Output of scored donors

app.R: Shiny app source code

ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Preview (Shiny App)
The Shiny dashboard allows nonprofits to:

Filter donors by score, gender, and channel

View summary metrics and interactive plots

Download the filtered donor list as needed

ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Requirements
Ensure you have R and RStudio installed.

Install these packages if not already installed:

r
Copy
Edit
install.packages(c("shiny", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "readr"))
2. Setup
Download or clone the repository and place both of these files in the same folder:

app.R

donor_predictions.csv (generated by donor_model.R)

3. Launch the App
Open app.R in RStudio, then click "Run App" in the top right corner.

You can now explore the donor ratings interactively.
